# Notepad++ auto-complete for WordPress.

Notepad++ auto-completion for WordPress, it contains about 900 global functions with the definitions of functions, return types, brief descriptions, and parameters. The data is taken from the comments in the source code and from the official online documentation. Deprecated functions and parameters are not added.

Wordpress 4.2.2  
Notepad++ 6.7.7  

# Instalation

Wordpress keywords for autocomplete are merged with the default php keywords stored in `php.xml`. There are two XML files here, one with descriptions of functions, and the other without them. Rename the file that you want to `php.xml` and replace the `/plugins/APIs/php.xml` file ( create a backup of the original file in case you change your mind ).
